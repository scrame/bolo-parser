Maps selected by #bolo map experts (mostly nix), updated 5/31/2000

These are not the "best" maps, just something for relatively new players to try out other
than the dreaded Everard Island.  For over 3000 other maps, check the Bolo FTP Archive at <ftp://ftp.lgm.com/bolo>.  For general Bolo help, see the Bolo home page at <http://www.lgm.com/bolo/>. In particular, there's a whole section on maps in the rec.games.bolo FAQ at <http://www.lgm.com/bolo/guides/longfaq.html#maps>.

Here are some quick descriptions of just some of the maps enclosed. Hopefully you can figure out the characteristics of the others based on these.

Baringi - small 2x2 tournament map that encourages pill wars. Twin safe corner bases and trick-take pills are like a cross between "Filled Chew Toy" and "Easter Island III".
Chew Toy 96 - small circle that is extremely fast-paced, but unlike CT2 or CT3 this is not as amenable to the "base rape" style that is very much in vogue now.
DH-Oil Rig   - small 4 quads, variant of classic Oil Rig which was the 1st small 4-fold symmetric map, fast and exciting for 1x1 or 2x2.
Dream Soda V - medium oval, great for 2x2 or 3x3, best if you split the map east/west up front, then you get nice pillwars in the N & S ctr since you can't go through the middle.
Easter Island III - small rectangle, more spread out than CT's but still very fast paced for 1x1 or 2x2.
Gothic Industrial - small rectangle, similar to Easter Island 3.
Mutatis Mutandis - large and well designed with lots of texture, great for 3x3's or more.
Skew Toy 2 - small circle but subtly asymmetric, fast but not boring.
Slugfest IV - small rectangle, lots of little quads, good for 2x2.
